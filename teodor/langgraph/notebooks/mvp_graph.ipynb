Customers can be professionals with an \\nexisting customer number, or they can be walk-in customers. A daily rate will be charged for the number of days \\nthe items were at the customer’s site. The agreements tend to have a short validity period, often only a few days. \\nA rental agreement is a combination of two distribution orders: \\n \\n \\n \\nCustomers can either pay directly (cash) via the cash desk, or they can pay against a rental invoice (credit). Two \\nrental agreement order types are defined for that purpose: \\n• \\nCO1 – Cash via the cash desk: immediate payment of the rental deposit or the entire rental invoice as an \\nadvance invoice. The customer’s payment terms must be CSH (Cash), combined with payment method \\nCSD (Cash Desk). \\n• \\nCO2 – Credit against an invoice, applying the normal payment terms, such as 30 days end-of-month. \\n \\nDeposits can be used persuading the customer to return the rental items on time at the end of the rental \\nagreement. Upon return, the deposit is reconciliated against the advance payment at the beginning of the \\nagreement. \\nThe order to cash for rental process is simplified through a reduced scope: \\n• \\nThe rental store is existing warehouse 003, which is part of facility A03 in division AAA. \\n• \\nThe on-rent warehouse is R03, also part of facility A03. \\n• \\nThe Rental Counter is used to minimize the number of clicks within the end-to-end process. \\n• \\nRental rates are expressed in weekdays. Seven-day weeks are used. Days rented out invoiced. Metered \\nserial numbers will be invoiced for over usage hours, based on a meter-specific rental price list. \\n• \\nCharges can be added for rental lines. \\n• \\nDiscounts can be added to rental lines. \\n• \\nActive rental agreements will automatically generate a maintenance agreement with the same number. \\nThis maintenance agreement is automatically connected to the serial number and will facilitate the \\nprocess when the customers report equipment break downs. This is covered in the service process. \\n• \\nUp rent and down rent are possible in case the wanted rental item is not in stock. \\n• \\nThe checkout is simplified from the rental store 003. Once the rental contract is activated, the rental items \\ngo on-rent automatically. No extra clicks are required. For metered serial numbers, the checkout meter \\nvalue is recorded. \\n• \\nA rental item can have a serial number, but that is not required. Serial numbers can be subject to an off-\\nhire inspection. Serial numbers also have a replacement value defined. \\n• \\nConsumables (spare parts) can be sold via the rental agreement. These items do not return to the rental \\nstore 003. \\n• \\nA rental line can be converted into an involuntary sale when the rental item is damaged beyond repair. \\nThe principle is “you break it, you buy it”. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 2, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  2 \\n \\n• \\nA rental contract can be paused (stand down) if needs be. During the stand down period, the customer is \\nnot paying the rental rate. \\n• \\nThe check-in into rental store 003 is controlled via the picking list printout. This enables the rental \\ncoordinator to visually inspect the returned rental items. For metered serial numbers, the check-in meter \\nvalue is recorded. \\n• \\nAn off-hire inspection is activated for selected serialized items. \\n• \\nOnce the rental agreement (line) is invoiced, the maintenance agreement with the same number is \\nautomatically deactivated and removed from the serial number. \\n \\nA second and parallel rental depot is setup in facility A04 with the rental yard being branch warehouse A10.

The process includes the following sub-processes: \\n• \\nUse Rental Counter \\n• \\nCreate Walk-in Customer \\n• \\nIdentify Request \\n• \\nCreate Rental Agreement \\n• \\nRental Payments \\n \\n \\nUse Rental Counter \\nThe Rental Counter enables the rental coordinator to run the entire end-to-end process from one single \\napplication. Information from different programs and different screens is gathered on one single application. The \\nRental Counter is a web-mashup, deployed in the Infor H5 client. It is supported by Infor Product Development, \\nand because of that, it must be considered an application rather than a mashup. You can still use “classic” \\nnavigation in Infor M3 to run the end-to-end process for rental, but then you use a range of different individual \\nprograms, which is normal practice in Infor M3. See the tips section for more information. \\n \\nFor Cloud Suite Distribution Enterprise, a light version of the rental process was added to the solution. The rental \\ncoordinator does everything over the counter, facing the customer directly. The limited complexity of the rental \\nitems allows the customer a high level of self-service. The rental coordinator needs to convert the customer’s \\nchoices into a rental agreement. Integration with the Cash Desk makes the processes smoother and lighter. \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 4, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  4 \\n \\nCreate Walk-in Customer \\nRental is an additional revenue stream in the distribution industry. Most often, the customer is unknown when they \\nwalk up to the rental counter. A true walk-in customer, also known as a sundry customer. Yet, when renting out to \\nthe customer, a minimum of information must be known. Some form of traceability is necessary. A rental \\nagreement is a binding contract, after all. A temporary customer is perfect for that purpose. A new walk-in \\ncustomer can be created on the fly via the Rental Counter, prior to registering the rental agreement. A category 8 \\ntemporary customer is created in Customer. Open (CRS610). \\n \\nNormal European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is valid for walk-in customers. \\n \\n \\n \\nIdentify Request \\nA known customer, or a walk-in customer wants to rent items from the warehouse (rental store). In the rental \\nprocess, the customer location address is a central key value. It determines who is renting and where exactly the \\nrental item is going to be used. \\n \\nOnce it established who will rent, the next part is to select the rental items. Rental can have a serial number, but \\nthat is not mandatory. When an item is not in stock, the Rental Counter will inform the rental coordinator about it. \\nSome items are consumables and can be sold, rather than rented. \\nThe normal end-to-end business processes, such as procure to pay, are used to bring rental items into rental \\nstore warehouse 003. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 5, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  5 \\n \\nCreate Rental Agreement \\nOnce the customer and the rental item (equipment) are selected, the agreement can be created. There are three \\nchoices: \\n1. \\nActive agreement (prefix A). The agreement goes “on-rent” immediately. That means the rental items \\n“leave” warehouse 003 onto the on-rent warehouse R03. For metered items, the check-out meter \\nreading is done. \\n2. \\nQuotation agreement (prefix Q). The quotation must be approved by the customer. This lies outside \\nof the scope. \\n3. \\nTemporary agreement (prefix T). This agreement must be converted into an active agreement. \\nBecause it is temporary, it is easier to change information such as sales or rental prices, add \\ndiscounts, add line charges, etc. It gives more control to the rental coordinator to meet the customer’s \\ndemands. \\n \\n \\nRental Payments \\nAn active (A) agreement can be paid for via the cash desk using rental agreement type CO1. It can be to collect a \\ndeposit amount at the beginning of the agreement and/or to control the payment when the agreement is finally \\ninvoiced. Deposits are only possible when the rental agreement type is enabled for it. If that is not the case, the \\ncash payment will take place when the rental agreement is terminated. The customer’s payment method will \\ndecide whether the cash desk is used or not. \\n \\nThe cash desk payments received via the Rental Counter and the Cash Desk are validated regularly, along with \\nany other cash payments received. Usually this is done at the end of the day, once the Cash Desk and the Rental \\nCounter processes are complete. When the cash desk is validated a new validation date is set, normally for the \\nnext working day and no more cash payments may be received in the Cash Desk. On validation, Accounts \\nReceivable and the General Ledger are updated. \\nManage On-rent Agreements \\nThe Manage On-rent Agreements process include tasks that can be performed when a unit is on rent. The \\nprocess includes the following sub-processes: \\n• \\nManage Stand-down Periods \\n• \\nEnter Involuntary Sales \\n• \\nMass-update Rental Lines \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 6, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  6 \\n \\nManage Stand-down Periods \\nThere are valid reasons why the customer should not be paying for the on-rent items. A classic example is a \\npublic (bank) holiday, such as Christmas day or New Year’s Day. \\n \\nOne or several intervals of dates can be defined for the rental agreement line where the agreement stands down. \\nDuring this interval, the customer is not invoiced. \\n \\n \\n \\nEnter Involuntary Sales \\nIt happens that the customer damages or breaks the rental item(s). The principle here is “you break it, you buy it”. \\nThe rental agreement line can be converted into a sales line, albeit involuntary on the customer’s perspective. \\nThat means that the customer owns the damaged rental item. There is no need any more to return it to the rental \\nwarehouse 003. \\n \\nThe sales price is determined by the rental coordinator. The replacement value for the rental item in question in \\nItem. Open Service Supplement (SOS001) is a good indication. The customer will pay for the rental days as well \\nas the (involuntary) sales price of the rental item. \\n \\nNote: The Enter Involuntary Sales process diagram is sililar to the Manage Stand-down Periods process. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 7, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  7 \\n \\nMass-update Rental Lines \\nCustomers can change their minds. It should be easy to mass update all rental lines based on the customer’s \\nwishes. The most common change is the validity period for the rental agreement lines. From the Rental Counter, \\nyou can mass change the complete rental agreement. The change(s) will be inherited by all rental lines. \\n \\n \\n \\nExchange Rental Line \\nIt happens that the rental item breaks down, with the customer not to be blamed. Replacing (exchanging) the \\nrental item is the solution. The broken/damaged rental item returns to the rental depot and the replacement rental \\nitem is going on-rent immediately, enabling the customer to carry on until the end of the rental agreement.  \\n \\n \\nTerminate Rental Agreement to Payment \\nThe Terminate Rental Agreement to Payment process starts with the termination of the rental agreement and \\nstops with the invoicing and payment. The process includes the following sub-processes: \\n• \\nTerminate Rental Agreement \\n• \\nReport Goods Return \\n• \\nReport Off-hire Service \\n• \\nInvoice Rental Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 8, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  8 \\n \\nTerminate Rental Agreement \\nAn active (A) agreement will end when: \\n• \\nThe customer returns the rental items to warehouse 003. This can be before the end of the rental \\nagreement end date. \\n• \\nThe rental agreement reaches its end date. The customer is expected to return the rental goods to \\nwarehouse 003 at the correct date. \\nYou can terminate either the complete rental agreement, including all its rental lines, or you can terminate \\nindividual rental lines separately. Off-hire and terminate rental agreement mean the same thing. Knowing the start \\nand the end date of the rental contract is good information to determine when to terminate the agreement. \\n \\n \\nReport Goods Return \\nThe rental agreement was terminated. The rental coordinator now has to check-in the rental items. Check-in is the \\nsame as receiving the rental items back into warehouse 003. When the rental item is metered, the check-in meter \\nwill be recorded. Consumption meters such as fuel tanks are out of scope. That said, the dispatch policy for the \\ninbound distribution order (R03=>003) is configured to stop this subprocess after automatic allocation (status 33). \\nIf not stopped, the system would automatically receive the distribution order (to status 99) and the rental \\ncoordinator has no control over the check-in process. \\n \\nRelease for picking for the inbound distribution order’s delivery number will: \\n• \\nReceive the rental items (both serialized and non-serialized) back in warehouse 003. See the result in \\nStock Transaction. Display History (MWS070). \\n• \\nTrigger the RENTAL OFF-HIRE service via a work order request. That request will automatically convert \\nitself into a work order. See more details on the RENTAL OFF-HIRE service, also known as the turn-\\naround service in the Report Off-Hire Service document. \\nThe rental lines can now be invoiced. \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 9, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  9 \\n \\nReport Off-hire Service \\nThe rental agreement was terminated, and the rental items have been received back into warehouse 003. A \\nvisual inspection is done by the rental coordinator, making sure that the received rental equipment is complete, \\nclean and in working order. The invoicing of the rental agreement can take place before this off-hire inspection is \\ndone. The RENTAL OFF-HIRE service is defined with just one operation line: visually checking the rental item. In \\ncase the rental item is damaged, it can be quarantined.  \\nDescribed in the service process, a separate ADHOC FIELD SERVICE can be created to repair the damage and \\nif needs be, invoice the customer for the used time and material. The repair will also take the rental out of \\nquarantine and back into the rental fleet.  \\n \\n \\nInvoice Rental Agreement \\nThe process includes the following sub-processes: \\n• \\nReconcile Deposit \\n• \\nProcess Invoice Proposal \\n• \\nCreate Invoice \\n• \\nCreate Credit Note \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 10, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  10 \\n \\nReconcile Deposit \\nDeposits are used as a security. It will ensure that the rented items are returned. A deposit was paid by the \\ncustomer when the rental agreement with rental order type CO1 was activated. The cash desk was used to collect \\nthis deposit. \\nAt the end of the rental agreement, the customer returns the rental items to the warehouse. Now is the time to \\ncompare the deposit paid with the actual rental cost. You reconcile the deposit. \\n• \\nWhen the deposit exceeds the actual rental cost, a credit note will be generated to pay this amount back to \\nthe customer. This can happen when the customer returns the rental items early. \\n• \\nWhen the deposit does not cover the actual rental cost, an invoice will be generated to bill the customer \\nthis extra charge. Happens when the customer returns the rental items too late. \\nWhen the deposit and the actual rental cost is equal, nothing will be invoiced. Happens when the customer \\nreturns the rental goods on-time. \\n \\nProcess Invoice Proposal \\nInvoicing a rental agreement is a four-step process: \\n1. Create an invoice proposal. \\n2. Review the created invoice proposal. \\n3. Approve the created invoice proposal (optional). \\n4. Create the rental invoice based on the approved invoice proposal. This is optional in this document. Refer \\nto the Create Invoice document. \\nThe first three steps cover the invoice proposal. Optional instructions are added to continue all the way to a rental \\ninvoice, but it is advised to not go beyond the invoice proposal stage. \\n \\nCreate Invoice \\nThis represents the last step in the invoicing process. An invoice proposal can already exist, but that is not \\nmandatory. The four steps covered in the invoice proposal can be condensed into one single step by click the \\nPayment icon in the Rental Counter. When the customer has payment method CSD, the cash desk will be \\npresented showing the grand total of all rental lines and consumable/spare parts sales lines. \\n \\nCreate Credit Note \\nA customer can contest a rental invoice. Most commonly due to incorrect pricing or forgotten discounts. There are \\nthree options to overcome this problem. Each of these three options will have a connection back to the original \\nrental invoice number to maximize traceability. \\n1. Partial credit – Changes can be made, and the credit note is generated. The total credited amount cannot \\nexceed the original invoice amount. \\n2. Full credit – Changes cannot be made, and the full amount is credited. The invoice is annulled. \\n3. Credit and re-invoice – Like option 2, but the system will re-invoice the net difference through a new \\ninvoice number. This option is not valid for rental agreement with collected deposit amounts. \\nJust like rental invoicing, rental crediting has different steps: \\n1. Create a credit proposal, choosing one of the 3 options described here above. \\n2. Amend the amounts, but only for partial credit (option 1) and credit/re-invoice (option 3). \\n3. Approve the amended credit proposal. \\n4. Create the credit note. \\nNote: Steps 3 and 4 can be compressed to one click in the Rental Counter: click the Payment icon. When the \\npayment method is cash (CSD), it is possible to pass via the cash desk in Cash Payment. Open (OIS215). The \\namounts will be negative. \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 11, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf'}, page_content='DISXRA Rental Agreement to Invoice.docx \\n \\nPage  11 \\n \\nRecord Payment \\nWe refer to the Financial Plan to Report processes and, the Accounts Receivable – Customer \\nPayments process (DISXFI.25 and DISXFI.25.05), for the recording of the payment. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n')], images=[])]\n",

Customers can be professionals with an \\nexisting customer number, or they can be walk-in customers. A daily rate will be charged for the number of days \\nthe items were at the customer’s site. The agreements tend to have a short validity period, often only a few days. \\nA rental agreement is a combination of two distribution orders: \\n \\n \\n \\nCustomers can either pay directly (cash) via the cash desk, or they can pay against a rental invoice (credit). Two \\nrental agreement order types are defined for that purpose: \\n• \\nCO1 – Cash via the cash desk: immediate payment of the rental deposit or the entire rental invoice as an \\nadvance invoice. The customer’s payment terms must be CSH (Cash), combined with payment method \\nCSD (Cash Desk). \\n• \\nCO2 – Credit against an invoice, applying the normal payment terms, such as 30 days end-of-month. \\n \\nDeposits can be used persuading the customer to return the rental items on time at the end of the rental \\nagreement. Upon return, the deposit is reconciliated against the advance payment at the beginning of the \\nagreement. \\nThe order to cash for rental process is simplified through a reduced scope: \\n• \\nThe rental store is existing warehouse 003, which is part of facility A03 in division AAA. \\n• \\nThe on-rent warehouse is R03, also part of facility A03. \\n• \\nThe Rental Counter is used to minimize the number of clicks within the end-to-end process. \\n• \\nRental rates are expressed in weekdays. Seven-day weeks are used. Days rented out invoiced. Metered \\nserial numbers will be invoiced for over usage hours, based on a meter-specific rental price list. \\n• \\nCharges can be added for rental lines. \\n• \\nDiscounts can be added to rental lines. \\n• \\nActive rental agreements will automatically generate a maintenance agreement with the same number. \\nThis maintenance agreement is automatically connected to the serial number and will facilitate the \\nprocess when the customers report equipment break downs. This is covered in the service process. \\n• \\nUp rent and down rent are possible in case the wanted rental item is not in stock. \\n• \\nThe checkout is simplified from the rental store 003. Once the rental contract is activated, the rental items \\ngo on-rent automatically. No extra clicks are required. For metered serial numbers, the checkout meter \\nvalue is recorded. \\n• \\nA rental item can have a serial number, but that is not required. Serial numbers can be subject to an off-\\nhire inspection. Serial numbers also have a replacement value defined. \\n• \\nConsumables (spare parts) can be sold via the rental agreement. These items do not return to the rental \\nstore 003. \\n• \\nA rental line can be converted into an involuntary sale when the rental item is damaged beyond repair. \\nThe principle is “you break it, you buy it”. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 2, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf', 'image': PDF_Image(id=UUID('7fc0e1ad-e3a8-4ebd-b271-dddb8028ed92'), content='The content of the image outlines a rental agreement process, detailing specific procedures and data related to rental contracts and facilities.

This agreement must be converted into an active agreement. \\nBecause it is temporary, it is easier to change information such as sales or rental prices, add \\ndiscounts, add line charges, etc. It gives more control to the rental coordinator to meet the customer’s \\ndemands. \\n \\n \\nRental Payments \\nAn active (A) agreement can be paid for via the cash desk using rental agreement type CO1. It can be to collect a \\ndeposit amount at the beginning of the agreement and/or to control the payment when the agreement is finally \\ninvoiced.

The principle here is “you break it, you buy it”. \\nThe rental agreement line can be converted into a sales line, albeit involuntary on the customer’s perspective. \\nThat means that the customer owns the damaged rental item. There is no need any more to return it to the rental \\nwarehouse 003. \\n \\nThe sales price is determined by the rental coordinator. The replacement value for the rental item in question in \\nItem. Open Service Supplement (SOS001) is a good indication.

It will ensure that the rented items are returned. A deposit was paid by the \\ncustomer when the rental agreement with rental order type CO1 was activated. The cash desk was used to collect \\nthis deposit. \\nAt the end of the rental agreement, the customer returns the rental items to the warehouse. Now is the time to \\ncompare the deposit paid with the actual rental cost. You reconcile the deposit. \\n• \\nWhen the deposit exceeds the actual rental cost, a credit note will be generated to pay this amount back to \\nthe customer. This can happen when the customer returns the rental items early. \\n• \\nWhen the deposit does not cover the actual rental cost, an invoice will be generated to bill the customer \\nthis extra charge. Happens when the customer returns the rental items too late. \\nWhen the deposit and the actual rental cost is equal, nothing will be invoiced. Happens when the customer \\nreturns the rental goods on-time. \\n \\nProcess Invoice Proposal \\nInvoicing a rental agreement is a four-step process: \\n1. Create an invoice proposal. \\n2. Review the created invoice proposal. \\n3. Approve the created invoice proposal (optional). \\n4. Create the rental invoice based on the approved invoice proposal. This is optional in this document. Refer \\nto the Create Invoice document. \\nThe first three steps cover the invoice proposal. Optional instructions are added to continue all the way to a rental \\ninvoice, but it is advised to not go beyond the invoice proposal stage. \\n \\nCreate Invoice \\nThis represents the last step in the invoicing process. An invoice proposal can already exist, but that is not \\nmandatory. The four steps covered in the invoice proposal can be condensed into one single step by click the \\nPayment icon in the Rental Counter. When the customer has payment method CSD, the cash desk will be \\npresented showing the grand total of all rental lines and consumable/spare parts sales lines. \\n \\nCreate Credit Note \\nA customer can contest a rental invoice. Most commonly due to incorrect pricing or forgotten discounts. There are \\nthree options to overcome this problem. Each of these three options will have a connection back to the original \\nrental invoice number to maximize traceability. \\n1. Partial credit – Changes can be made, and the credit note is generated. The total credited amount cannot \\nexceed the original invoice amount. \\n2. Full credit – Changes cannot be made, and the full amount is credited. The invoice is annulled. \\n3. Credit and re-invoice – Like option 2, but the system will re-invoice the net difference through a new \\ninvoice number. This option is not valid for rental agreement with collected deposit amounts. \\nJust like rental invoicing, rental crediting has different steps: \\n1. Create a credit proposal, choosing one of the 3 options described here above. \\n2. Amend the amounts, but only for partial credit (option 1) and credit/re-invoice (option 3). \\n3. Approve the amended credit proposal. \\n4. Create the credit note. \\nNote: Steps 3 and 4 can be compressed to one click in the Rental Counter: click the Payment icon. When the \\npayment method is cash (CSD), it is possible to pass via the cash desk in Cash Payment. Open (OIS215). The \\namounts will be negative. \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '../../data/test_with_images.pdf', 'page_number': 11, 'file_name': 'test_with_images.pdf', 'image': PDF_Image(id=UUID('ae5c2212-62db-4e3d-b379-11ce15c31a18'), content='The image appears to be a flowchart detailing the process for recording customer payments within an accounts receivable framework.
