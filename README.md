Got it üöÄ I‚Äôll help you ‚Äúpimp up‚Äù the README so it looks professional, engaging, and explains your project clearly to newcomers (both techies and non-techies). Here‚Äôs a rewritten version of your README with stronger descriptions, storytelling, and structure:

Description

This project was built in collaboration with Infor, the world‚Äôs third-largest ERP provider, to solve a real-world bottleneck:
üí° The company spends tens of thousands of hours every year on manual software testing. Testers read PDFs with step-by-step instructions and then manually click through the ERP system‚Äôs UI.

We created an AI-driven solution that automates both test creation and test execution by combining:
	‚Ä¢	Browser-Use (agent framework)
	‚Ä¢	GPT-4o (multimodal reasoning on screenshots & HTML)
	‚Ä¢	Playwright (E2E test automation)
	‚Ä¢	Next.js (intuitive frontend)

üëâ The result: Deterministic Playwright test scripts automatically generated from an AI agent‚Äôs navigation, with full traceability through screenshots. This makes tests fast, repeatable, and scalable ‚Äì without writing a single line of code.

‚∏ª

Key Features
	‚Ä¢	‚ö° Massive time savings ‚Äì reduces thousands of hours of manual testing every year.
	‚Ä¢	üñ±Ô∏è No-code test generation ‚Äì users create end-to-end tests without programming knowledge.
	‚Ä¢	ü§ñ AI-powered navigation ‚Äì GPT-4o agents explore web UIs using screenshots and HTML.
	‚Ä¢	üìú Deterministic Playwright scripts ‚Äì reproducible and reliable automation output.
	‚Ä¢	üé® User-friendly frontend ‚Äì request tests, view screenshots of each action, and export working scripts.

Would you like me to also make a shorter, more business-facing README summary (like a pitch for non-technical visitors on GitHub) in addition to this detailed developer README?
